    "description": "In the VRPB, vehicles must serve customers with both delivery and pickup demands. Deliveries (customers not in the backhaul set) must be completed before any pickups (customers in the backhaul set) on a route. Each customer is visited exactly once and capacity constraints (for both delivery and pickup loads) must be respected. The objective is to minimize the total distance traveled by all vehicles.",
